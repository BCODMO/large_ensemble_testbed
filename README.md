A three-dimensional hydrodynamic model of Lake Michigan that simulates the redistribution of a conservative tracer. 
The tracer follows the time history of phosphorus inputs. The tracer is input to the lake from 11 tributaries.

[doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4222538](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.4222538) contains a collection of input files to force MITgcm-Michigan-Phosphorus and output from the simulation.

If you have any questions or concerns, please either open up an issue in this repository or contact Luke directly (gloege at ldeo.columbia.edu).
